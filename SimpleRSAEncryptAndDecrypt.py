# Hello sir, this is Christopher Drape! This is my first time coding with Python
# and for some reason I always have missing characters or an output that's different 
# from your sample data. I think this is because of my coding environment.

# It would be appreciated if you could give me a little feedback on what I have 
# done wrong here because I am pretty clueless right now Hahaha. If you're
# busy that's fine too! Thank you for your time sir!
